<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p>This project was built to defend against third parties attempting to logon (and presumably compromise) an Windows Remote Desktop system that is exposed to the Internet.</p>
<p>In principle it is a Windows Service monitors the Windows Security EventLog looking for failed logon attempts and blocks those that have an unexpected pattern... by default based on particular usernames (*ADMIN* is a favourite) or whether a particular IP has initiated a filed logon multiple times within a time period. Once a pattern is detected it blocks all traffic from that IP address for a set period of time.</p>

<p>The project is C# and was originally built with Visual Studio 2019. It is targetted against Microsoft.NET Framework v4.7.2.</p>
